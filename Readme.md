## Prerequisites 

- Rust (as per [cargo-msrv](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-msrv) the MSRV seems to be 1.74.1)
- OpenCV development library (libopencv-dev)

## Building 

Coming soon 

## Future updates

Here you can use a Special GFM Feature called a task list. A task list will show which things are done and which are pending. You can utilize a task list as

- [ ] Flexible amount of LEDs
- [x] Configure at which edge of the screen the lightstrip starts 
- [x] Select if the lightstrip is placed clockwise or counter clockwise
- [ ] Simple webserver to turn ambilight on/off (homekit)
